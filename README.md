GitHub Workflows Repository
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I have meticulously documented various CI/CD workflows and tools for improving development efficiency and project quality. These workflows are currently stored in .txt format to ensure they do not execute automatically. To activate and use these workflows, you need to convert them into .yaml files and place them in the .git/workflows/ directory.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and knowledge in creating and managing workflows for software development projects.

Available Workflow Files
Below is the list of workflow files included in this repository:

Go Tests and SonarQube Analysis

Contributing
Contributions to improve or extend these workflows are welcome! If you have suggestions or new ideas, feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.

By keeping these workflows in .txt format initially, I ensure they serve as references and are only executed intentionally. This approach demonstrates my commitment to responsible development practices and showcases my expertise in setting up CI/CD pipelines.
